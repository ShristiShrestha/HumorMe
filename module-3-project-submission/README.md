Submission guidelines

1. Complete source code of UserRegistrationServlet.java and UserRegistration.html

   - I have renamed the URL path inside UserRegistrationServlet.java to ` ``/register ``.
   - Also, UserRegistration.html has been renamed to `index.html`.
   - I have added an additional jsp files: `userinfo.jsp and error.jsp to display user registered information (on success) and `
     error details (on missing any of the input values) respectively.
2. Screenshots of your output, including Figures 1, 2, and 3 (see the following figures, remember, your output doesnâ€™t need to be exactly the same).

   - The [screenshots](/screenshots) folder contains three image files showing the landing page (index.jpg), success page (success.jpg) and error page (error.jpg)
3. Although the demo Figure 1, 2, and 3 use localhost for illustration purposes, please make sure that the TA is able to access your website through the public IP of your EC2 instance. So you should keep your EC2 instance running until the end of the project deadline.
