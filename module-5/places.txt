Their app doesn't work very well, but once you get it started, you can come here for your breakfast pastries and earn points. I found all of their pastries to be very good. I like the ham and Swiss croissant, and the flatbread chorizo. Delicious for a treat yourself day!"

The they had made already for about 2 hours old so they asked if I had a little time and 5mins I'd have fresh coffee.Really not a big deal to me but I said sure I'd wait and it was really good. I prefer it over Starbucks, and the staff are friendly."
